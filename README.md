# Handwriting Text Recognition for IAM Dataset

This repository contains our work on Offline Handwriting Recognition.<br>
A detailed report on this project can be found [here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/handwriting-text-recognition-3712978249da)

Handwritten Text Recongnition implemented using two initial approaches namely KNN on IAM dataset [1] and CNN on character only dataset [2].

## Initial Approaches: Approach 1

![KNN](./KNN.png)

Download some demo files from the IAM dataset and store them in the folder where you store the code for this approach. Run the code for one image at a time to see how each step described in the image is implemented in the code.

## Initial Approaches: Approach 2

![CNN](./CNN.png)

Download the character dataset and store the entire dataset in the folder where you store the code for this approach. Run the code too see how the CNN model interprets and detects different characters from capital and small case alphabets and digits.
